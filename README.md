To run, navigate to the folder in terminal and you should see two folders and a readme

> docs 
> server
> README.md

go into the server folder with

> cd server

and start the server with 

> node server.js

the server should start and navigate to back to the docs file and open up index.html by doing:

> cd ../docs
> open index.html

To play on a server with friends, replace the url in the server.js file with you server url (tested on GCP and it works)
